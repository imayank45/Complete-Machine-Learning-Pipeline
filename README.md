# Complete-Machine-Learning-Pipeline
This project covers end to end understanding for creating ML pipeline and working around it using DVC for experiment tracking and data versioning (using AWS S3).


## Building a pipeline:
1. Create a GitHub repository and clone it to the local and add experiments.
2. Add src folder along with all the components (run them individually).
3. Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore
4. Now do git add, commit and push files to the repository
